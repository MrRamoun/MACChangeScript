# MACChangeScript
A new project to change a mac address in Kali Linux 
I am super excited by this project as I really find this idea useful!!!
This uses eth0 as the interface, if you use a different interface please change as needed.
Please do not be too harsh as this is a beginner script and I am not used to adding user input.
This automates the macchanger command in Kali Linux, awesome if you need to change your mac for an ARP spoofing attack.
Please use this only for LEGAL purposes.
I hope it works and enjoy feedback. Thank you everyone for being great!!
